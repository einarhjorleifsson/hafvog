# hafvog

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of hafvog is to read in the hafvogs json files into R

## Installation

You can install the development version of hafvog from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
remotes::install_github("einarhjorleifsson/hafvog@3-un-used-variable-names")
```

## The fundamental stuff

With {hafvog} you can read in the content of the hafvog zip files via:

```{r example}
library(hafvog)
zip_path <- system.file("zips", "A3-2024.zip", package = "hafvog")
d <- hv_read_hafvog(zip_path, collapse_station = TRUE)

d$stodvar |> 
  dplyr::left_join(d$skraning) |> 
  dplyr::glimpse()
```
